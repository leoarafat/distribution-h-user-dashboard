        Contractor shall be provided with monthly statements detailing the sums

        contractor's email(pdf, excel), or through any other mean determined by
        Be Musix Limited, on the first day of the second month following the
        month during which the sums have been received by Be Musix Limited. For
        instance: February Statements shall be available on April 1st, March
        Statements shall be available on May 1st When Contractor provides
        Distributor (through this Agreement or otherwise) with its
        identification number for VAT/GST/Sales Tax (hereinafter "VAT number"),
        Contractor warrants that this VAT number is accurate and valid.
        Contractor shall inform Distributor of any change in the VAT number
        without delay. If a VAT number is not provided to Be Musix Limited,
        Contractor warrants that it is not, and is not required to be,
        VAT/GST/Sales Tax registered. In order to speed up the invoice and
        payment process by Be Musix Limited, Contractor exclusively mandates Be
        Musix Limited, who accepts, to issue invoices via the Distributor's
        self-billing process, with effect as of the availability of the same.
        Accordingly, Contractor shall (ii) not issue any invoice for which the
        billing mandate is given under this Agreement, (ii) sign any billing
        mandate required by law (iii) be deemed to have accepted the self-billed
        invoices (and shall confirm in writing such acceptance upon
        Distributor's request), excepted those disputed in writing, and (iv)
        retain the invoices issued by Distributor or Be Musix Limited.
        <br />
        <strong>INVOICING:</strong>
        {""}
        For the purpose of the billing mandate, Contractor shall provide
        Distributor in writing with (i) any information required to issue the
        self-invoice, and (ii) any change in its situation that may have an
        impact on the billing mandate. Upon Contractor's request through
        Dashboard or through any other mean as determined by Distributor, Be
        Musix Limited, the Contractor's invoice related to any available
        statement shall be automatically issued (through dashboard or any other
        mean as determined by Distributor). Any invoice issued by Distributor
        shall mention the language "SELF-BILLING" and comply with the
        requirements for a valid invoice.
        <br />
        <strong>PAYMENT/TAX INFORMATION :</strong>
        {""}
        Following availability of the last statement of the ongoing calendar
        month, Be Musix Limited shall issue payment to Contractor on monthly
        within 30 days after receipt of each valid and undisputed invoice (or,
        in case of self-billing, following issuance by Distributor). If the
        balance of Contractor's account is less than 100 euros (or equivalent in
        the currency of the Agreement), this balance will be rolled into the
        following payment period. Invoices will be irrevocable after payment is
        made. Payment will be made by bank transfer(NPSB/RTGS or online
        transfer). Contractor shall bear any bank fees other than Be Musix
        Limited bank. All payments shall be made in BDT. Payments made by Be
        Musix Limited shall be exclusive of VAT, unless: (i) Contractor provided
        a valid VAT number; and (ii) local law requires such taxes to be
        charged. Contractor declares having informed Be Musix Limited of its tax
        residence country before signing this Agreement. Payment is conditioned
        upon communication of this information. Contractor shall immediately
        inform Be Musix Limited of any change of tax residence during the
        Exclusive Distribution Period. Contractor shall provide its tax
        residence certificate upon distributor's reasonable request. Should the
        Contractor be in breach of its obligation to provide accurate
        information regarding its Tax residence country, and should distributor
        be obliged to pay any extra cost (including withholding taxes) resulting
        from such default, distributor shall be entitled to request the
        immediate reimbursement by Contractor of such costs Each statement,
        account information, or financial information is considered as
        definitively true, accurate and accepted, unless Contractor disputes it
        in writing, within 2 years following the availability of the same on
        dashboard
        <br />
        <strong>AUDIT :</strong>
        {""}
        Once a year, and once with respect to each statement, Contractor shall
        have the right to audit distributor's records to verify the accuracy of
        any statement issued in the past 24 months. Such audit shall be done at
        Contractor's expense, at the place where distributor's maintains such
        records, during distributor's normal business hours, subject to a 30
        days' prior written notice sent by registered letter with delivery
        receipt. In the event such audit reveals a discrepancy, distributor will
        pay Contractor the amount of the difference, upon presentation of a
        valid invoice by Contractor. If the discrepancy exceeds ten percent
        (10%), in addition Distributor will pay the reasonable fees incurred for
        the audit, upon presentation of the supporting documents, in the limit
        of the lower amount between (i) the discrepancy and (ii) 3.000 euros.

        actions. In any event, distributor, as well as the DSPs, may also take
        any and all measures they deem appropriate and/or necessary, in their
        sole discretion, in order to settle or stop the Claim against
        distributor including but not limited to;(i) suspending any part of this

        insufficient to settle the Claim, distributor will have the right to
        assume sole control to conduct the trial or settlement of such Claim or
        any related negotiations. Contractor shall provide reasonable
        information requested by distributor in connection with the Claim and
        shall collaborate closely with distributor in relation to the Claim.
        Distributor shall make reasonable endeavours to mitigate the damages and
        to inform Contractor of any settlement and/or judicial discussions so

        limitation, reasonable external lawyers' fees): (i) paid or incurred in
        connection with any Claim for breach or default of any obligation,
        representation or warranty made hereunder; (ii) arising from the
        exploitation of the Content in compliance with the Agreement.
        Accordingly, Contractor shall hold harmless Distributor for any sum that
        Distributor may be liable to pay in dealing with a Claim or may be
        ordered to pay by a court of competent jurisdiction or by way of
        mutually agreed settlement; (iii) incurred in connection with a Claim by
        any person for any payment based upon an agreement with the Indemnifying
        Party (or any person acting on its behalf) in connection with this
        Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if a Claim is not due to any
        action, a breach or negligence by Contractor, the damages, losses,
        costs, and expenses incurred by Distributor shall be equally borne by
        both parties. If the Indemnified Party owes amounts to the Indemnifying
        Party under this Agreement, it shall be entitled to deduct from those
        amounts any sum due by the Indemnifying Party if any and it shall inform
        the Indemnifying Party of such deduction. Where the amounts owed are

        15 days of the date of a valid invoice setting out the same, which shall

        notification until cure of the breach. Distributor shall release all
        amounts withheld if the breach is cured to Distributor's satisfaction

        Distributor shall, following the expiry of such cure period if
        applicable, be entitled, at its sole discretion acting reasonably and
        proportionately to damages suffered by Distributor as a direct result of
        the breach, to: (i) in addition to the suspension of any payments to
        Contractor, suspend all or part of its other obligations provided in
        this Agreement for as long as the default is not rectified; and/or (ii)
        request immediate reimbursement of any sums remaining on Contractor's
        balance account, including any unrecouped Advance and/or fundings where
        applicable; and/or (iii) terminate this Agreement by written notice to
        Contractor. The measures referred to in this section can be cumulative
        and shall not prevent Distributor from seeking indemnification, damages
        or any other remedy from the Contractor, including the immediate payment
        by Contractor of liquidated damages if any, to be more specifically
        determined at the time of the event based on Distributor's calculations
        of actual losses caused by a material breach hereunder. The parties
        confirm that these remedies are reasonable and proportionate to protect
        Distributor's legitimate interest in the performance of Contractor's
        obligations hereunder
